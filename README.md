# Authorized Guest Plugin for Moodle
This authentication plugin allows users to be automatically logged in, if a specific paramter is set in the URL.
A typical use case is a demo system. If you want to demonstrate some features that would usually require creating an account like attempting a quiz, this plugin allows user  to be automatically logged in with previously created guest accounts. The demonstrator just needs to provide the URL to the quiz and add the trigger paramter to the URL (default: 'authorizedguest').

## Demo
[This Moodle system](https://moodleresearch.hs-bochum.de) demonstrates the usage of the plugin.
